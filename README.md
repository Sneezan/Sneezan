### Hi there 👋

- 👋 I'm Cecilia, a frontend developer based in Stockholm, Sweden.
- 🪐 My stack include, but is not limited to: JavaScript & TypeScript, React, CSS HTML, Node.js, Redux, Express, MongoDB
- 👻 I'm one of those crazy people that really enjoy react and styled components.
- 🌱 Check out my final project, Project Gripp https://github.com/Sneezan/project-gripp
- 💎 I like stuff that's shiny, cats, champagne and fresh flowers (you know, all the good things)

## 🙋🏻‍♀️ I'm up for grabs as a developer in Stockholm or remote!
Currently, I'm an intern at Stryda (@g-loot) where I work with react and TypeScript, but I'm also looking for a full-time role ⭐️
