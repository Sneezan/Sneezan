### Hi there 👋

- 👋 I'm Cecilia, a frontend developer based in Stockholm, Sweden.
- 🪐 My stack include, but is not limited to: JavaScript & TypeScript, React, CSS HTML, Node.js, Redux, Express, MongoDB
- 👻 I'm one of those crazy people that really enjoy react and styled components.
- 💎 I like stuff that's shiny, cats, champagne and fresh flowers (you know, all the good things)
- 🌱 Intern at [Stryda](https://stryda.gg) - TypeScript, React & React Query 

## Where am I?
Currently, I'm an intern at Stryda (@g-loot) where I work with react and TypeScript, but I'm also looking for a full-time role ⭐️
So I do contribute way more than is showed here, head over to @CeciliaStryda.
In the meantime - connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceciliafranlund)
