### Hi there 👋

- 👋 I'm Cecilia, a frontend developer based in Stockholm, Sweden.
- 🪐 My stack include, but is not limited to: JavaScript & React, CSS HTML, Node, Redux.
- 👻 I'm one of those crazy people that really enjoy react and styled components.

- 🌱 Currently I'm  working on my final project: get a Gripp -  a party game! 🎉 👀
- 💎 I like stuff that's shiny, cats, champagne and fresh flowers (you know, all the good things)


## 🙋🏻‍♀️ Currently: I'm up for grabs as a developer in Stockholm or remote!
What you'll get is a super energized and social employee (might be all the coffee I drink), that is in love
with code always up for a challenge ⭐️
